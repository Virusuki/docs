A Redis feature set represents the complete set of features available in a specific configuration, and its version number increments whenever a new feature is introduced.

To use a new feature introduced in a later feature set, you must upgrade to the corresponding feature set version, as outlined in the table below.


| Redis feature set version | What's new |
|-------------------|----------------|
| **Redis feature set version**: 7.4 <br>  **Component versions**:  [Redis 7.4]({{<relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisce/redisce-7.4-release-notes.md">}}) <br> [Redis Query Engine 2.10]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisearch/redisearch-2.10-release-notes.md" >}}) <br> [JSON 2.8]({{<relref "operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisjson/redisjson-2.8-release-notes.md">}}) <br> [Time series 1.12]({{<relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redistimeseries/redistimeseries-1.12-release-notes.md">}}) <br> [Bloom 2.8]({{<relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisbloom/redisbloom-2.8-release-notes.md">}}) | **Hash**: <br> Redis now supports [expiration of individual hash fields](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/hashes/#:~:text=C%23-,Field%20expiration,-New%20in%20Redis). <br> **Streams**: <br> It is now possible to start reading from the last stream message using [XREAD](https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/xread/) with the new id value `+`.<br> **Time series**: <br> The latest time series data structure adds a highly requested feature: insertion-filter for close samples. <br> **JSON**: <br> Introduces a fix to not duplicate `AOF` commands multiple times in [JSON.MSET](https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/json.mset/) <br> **Probabilistic**: <br> Now, an error is returned if [CMS.MERGE](https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/cms.merge/) results in an overflow or underflow. <br> **Redis Query Engine**: <br> - New `BFLOAT16` and `FLOAT16` vector data types, reducing memory consumed by vectors while preserving accuracy. <br> - Support for indexing empty and missing values and enhanced developer experience for queries with exact matching capabilities. <br> - Developers can now match `TAG` fields without needing to escape special characters, making the onboarding process and use of the query syntax simpler. <br> - Geospatial search capabilities have been expanded with new `INTERSECT` and `DISJOINT` operators, and ergonomics have been improved by providing better reporting of the memory consumed by the index and exposing the Full-text scoring in the aggregation pipeline. <br> **_Compatibility Changes_**: <br> Redis feature set 7.4 no longer includes triggers and functions. To ensure a seamless upgrade, remove any T&F functions created before loading an RDB file into the new Redis Stack. |
