## Enhancements

### Faster scaling with Redis hashing policy

Starting June DATE, 2025, new Redis Cloud accounts can create databases that scale faster. This makes resharding operations up to 40% faster than before.

Faster scaling requires:
- A new Redis cloud account, created after June DATE, 2025
- A new database running Redis 7.4 or later, with the [Redis hashing policy]({{< relref "/operate/rc/databases/configuration/clustering#redis-hashing-policy" >}}) selected

For these databases, this enhancement is enabled automatically, ensuring that all future resharding operations complete faster than ever.
