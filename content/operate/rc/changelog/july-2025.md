## New features

### Redis 8.0 preview

A preview of Redis 8.0 is now available for [Redis Cloud Essentials databases]({{< relref "/operate/rc/databases/create-database/create-essentials-database" >}}) in select regions.

Redis 8.0 introduces powerful new capabilities, including the beta release of the Vector Set data structure, designed for AI use cases such as semantic search and recommendation systems. For more information on the changes in Redis 8.0, see [What's new in Redis 8.0]({{<relref "/develop/whats-new/8-0" >}}) and review the [breaking changes]({{<relref "/operate/rc/changelog/version-release-notes/8-0" >}}).

### Dynamic endpoints

As of DATE, 2025, Redis Cloud now generates dynamic endpoints for all databases. Databases created before DATE, 2025 can still view both static endpoints and dynamic endpoints. Static endpoints will still work at this time, but they may be deprecated in the future.

We recommend slowly migrating connections to the dynamic endpoints. In the future, you'll be able to point the dynamic endpoints to a different database without any changes to your application code.
